# LSTM Forecast - CSV Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This is the first project of our team. The main goal of this code is to read, transform, process, and analyze a CSV file containing real data and its LSTM predictions.

## Instructions
We will be working with a dataset that contains various events, including normal events, anomalies, and errors. The task is to analyze the data, apply preprocessing techniques, and segment it by days of the week (24-hour periods). This segmentation will help us better understand the data patterns and improve our forecasting model.

This exercise will be an essential step toward building a robust prototype for our LSTM forecast model.

## Steps to Follow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the provided dataset.
   - Clean and format the data as needed.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   
2. **Segmentation by Day of the Week:**
   - Organize the data into 24-hour segments for each day of the week.
   - Identify trends and recurring patterns.

3. **Anomaly Detection:**
   - Analyze the dataset to distinguish between normal events, anomalies, and errors.
   - Extract meaningful insights from these anomalies.

4. **LSTM Training Variables:**
   - Review and use the key variables required for training the LSTM model.
   - Ensure proper data transformation to optimize model performance.

## Next Steps
Once the initial data analysis and segmentation are complete, we will proceed with the development and refinement of the LSTM forecast model prototype.
